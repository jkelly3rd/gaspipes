INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THE APPARENT CAUSE OF THE MAIN LEAK WAS DAMAGE DURING INSTALLATION OF A WATER MAIN; THE EXACT TIME PERIOD OF THE WATER MAIN INSTALLATION IS UNKNOWN. THIS CONCLUSION IS BASED ON THE OBSERVED DAMAGE AND PROXIMITY OF THE WATER MAIN. THE LOCATION OF THE MAIN LEAK WAS APPROXIMATELY 45 FEET FROM THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF THE HOUSE.

THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF AN EXPLOSION OR INDEED IGNITION OF GAS IN THE HOME, AND WHILE THERE WERE EXTREMELY LOW LEVELS OF GAS DETECTED IN THE BASEMENT BY FIRST RESPONDERS (0.16% GAS READS, OR 4% LEL), THIS SEEMS TO HAVE OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF ALL DOORS AND WINDOWS (INCLUDING THOSE IN THE BASEMENT) BEING OPENED BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, ALLOWING GAS TO ENTER THE HOME FROM OUTSIDE.  THERE WERE NO APPARENT CRACKS OR HOLES IN THE BASEMENT WALL WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE PROVIDE A PATH OF MIGRATION INTO THE HOME, AND NO LEAKS WERE FOUND ON THE METER OR THE STEEL GAS SERVICE TO THE HOME.  FURTHERMORE, THE MAJORITY OF FIRE DAMAGE WAS SOME DISTANCE FROM THE NORTHWEST SIDE OF THE BASEMENT (THE SIDE CLOSEST TO THE GAS FACILITIES)    THE FIRE DEPARTMENT CHIEF ON SITE WAS ULTIMATELY UNABLE TO COME TO A DETERMINATION ON THE CAUSE OF THE HOUSEFIRE.

2011,2011-07-06T13:44:00Z,135 CRAWFORD STREET,OXFORD,OAKLAND,CONSUMERS ENERGY CO,"CONTRACTOR ASI PAVING WHILE MILLING A PARKING LOT CUT THROUGH A 1-1/8"" PLASTIC MEDIUM PRESSURE GAS SERVICE TO 135 CRAWFORD CAUSING A FIRE AND IGNITING CONTRACTOR'S EQUIPMENT.  THE APARTMENT COMPLEX WAS EVACUATED.  THERE WERE NO INJURIES. OXFORD FIRE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED TO EXTINGUISH THE FIRE AND PUT IT OUT AT 14:41.  GAS FLOW WAS SQUEEZED OFF AT 15:30.  ONCE THE DAMAGED EQUIPMENT WAS REMOVED, THE DAMAGED SERVICE WAS REPAIRED AND THE GAS WAS BACK ON AT 00:30.    ASI PAVING HAD REQUESTED STAKING, WHICH WAS THEN ACCURATELY PROVIDED.  HOWEVER, THE 1-1/8"" PLASTIC THAT WAS DAMAGED WAS ONLY 2 INCHES BELOW THE BOTTOM OF THE 6-INCH THICK PAVEMENT BEING REMOVED. THIS MINIMAL DEPTH DID NOT ALLOW ASI TO HAND EXPOSE THE SERVICE TO DETERMINE DEPTH PRIOR TO REMOVING PAVEMENT (THE DAMAGE OCCURRED DURING THE PAVEMENT REMOVAL OPERATION).  IT IS SURMISED THAT THE 1-1/8"" PLASTIC SERVICE WAS BURIED AT PROPER DEPTH WHEN INSTALLED IN 1976, BUT SUBSEQUENT PARKING AREA GRADING SINCE THE INSTALLATION LIKELY CAUSED THE SERVICE TO BE AT A SHALLOW DEPTH.",0,0,YES,2011-07-06

BEATRICE IN THE CITY OF DETROIT, WAYNE COUNTY, MI. AT 06:22 MICHCON PERSONNEL ARRIVED AND REPORTED A WALL DOWN INSIDE THE BUILDING WITH NO OUTSIDE STRUCTURE DAMAGE.  MICHCON LOCATED A LEAK OVER A 4-INCH CAST IRON MAIN LOCATED ON DOWNING STREET APPROXIMATELY 67 FEET WEST OF BEATRICE.  A CIRCUMFERENTIAL CRACK WAS FOUND IN THE 4-INCH CAST IRON MAIN.  AT 11:30 MICHCON REPAIRED THE 4-INCH CAST IRON MAIN WITH A 4""X9"" REPAIR CLAMP AND THE LEAK WAS STOPPED.   THE DEPTH OF FROST WAS 18-INCHES WHICH CAUSED THE MAIN TO BREAK. THE DEPTH OF MAIN IS APPROXIMATELY 48-INCHES.    THE INCIDENT WAS A RESULT OF LEAKING GAS MIGRATING FROM THE BROKEN MAIN, THROUGH THE FRONT YARD, AND INTO A STORAGE ROOM LOCATED IN THE CENTER OF THE BUILDING.

FRANKS FURNITURE STORE.  OTHER NEARBY BUILDINGS WERE ALSO AFFECTED.  THERE WERE TWO FATALITIES.  ADDITIONALLY, TWO OTHER PEOPLE WERE INJURED REQUIRING HOSPITALIZATION.    AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION WAS CONDUCTED.  THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT REMAINS UNCERTAIN AND THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION ARE INCONCLUSIVE.  A LEAK INSIDE THE FURNITURE STORE PRIOR TO THE EXPLOSION CANNOT BE RULED OUT.  FROM THE INVESTIGATION TEAM'S REPORT, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES A PLAUSIBLE GAS MIGRATION ROUTE INTO THE BUILDING FROM THE 2 INCH MAIN SEPARATION WOULD HAVE BEEN BY WAY OF THE SANITARY SEWER PIPE THROUGH A SEWER CROCK.",2,2,YES,2010-12-29
